# S&P 500 Unsupervised Trading Algorithm

## Overview

This project develops an unsupervised learning algorithm designed to analyze financial indicators from the S&P 500 to autonomously discover and implement effective monthly investment strategies. By leveraging advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, this algorithm aims to identify profitable investment opportunities without predefined labels or targets.

## Features

- **Indicator Analysis**: Utilizes a variety of financial indicators including moving averages, MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and RSI (Relative Strength Index) to gauge market conditions.
- **Clustering Techniques**: Employs clustering methods to find patterns in the S&P 500 data that correlate with significant market movements.
- **Strategy Simulation**: Back-tests potential strategies to evaluate their effectiveness over historical data.
- **Monthly Updates**: Automatically adjusts strategies based on monthly market data and performance feedback.
- **Visualization**: Generates charts and graphs to visualize trends, performance, and potential market movements.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For algorithm development and data processing.
- **Pandas/NumPy**: For efficient data manipulation and numerical calculations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models and clustering techniques.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
